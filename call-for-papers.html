                <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                <p>Quantitative syntax analysis benefits from the thriving availability of structured language data in the (computational) linguistics field and the growing popularity of statistical methods within the linguistic community. Despite the rapid development of Corpus and Treebanks, the full linguistic potential of combining such structured data with statistical methods remains unexplored. QUASY 2025 responds to the growing need for linguistic meetings dedicated to quantitative syntax analysis and theorizing based on empirical data. The meeting is held under the auspices of the International Quantitative Linguistics Association (IQLA).</p>
                
                <h3>Topics</h3>
                <p>We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics related to quantitative syntax, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul class="topics-list">
                    <li>Explorations of syntax-related phenomena, incorporating psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, language typology, language acquisition, stylometry, and translation, using quantitative methods based on empirical language data.</li>
                    <li>Methods for analyzing corpora, treebanks, or other empirical datasets that contribute to syntax analysis.</li>
                    <li>Theoretical studies grounded in syntax data, such as hypothesis testing.</li>
                    <li>Investigations into the relationships between various syntactic factors.</li>
                    <li>Discussions on linguistic units or the impact of annotation conventions in syntax analysis.</li>
                    <li>Analyses of syntactic structures (tree structures, valency structures, etc.) and their distributions.</li>
                    <li>Modeling of syntax and its applications.</li>
                    <li>Studies of word order and its syntactic implications.</li>
                    <li>AI-driven approaches to syntactic analysis, including the use of machine learning for identifying patterns in large linguistic datasets.</li>
                </ul>
        

                <h3>Key Dates</h3>

                <h3>Submission Details</h3>
                <p><strong>Paper Submission Portal:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can submit your papers via the following portal: <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=SyntaxFest/2025" target="_blank">https://openreview.net/group?id=SyntaxFest/2025</a></li>
                    <li>Important Reminder: Please be aware that setting up an OpenReview account may take some time, especially if it is your first registration. To avoid any last-minute issues, we recommend completing your registration in advance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Submission Types:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular Papers:</strong> These should present significant, original, and unpublished research, including empirical results when applicable. The length should not exceed 8 pages (excluding references and appendices).</li>
                    <li><strong>Short Papers:</strong> These can focus on smaller, more specific contributions such as ongoing work, negative findings, surveys, or opinion pieces. The length should not exceed 4 pages (excluding references and appendices). Accepted short papers will receive an additional page to address reviewer comments.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Archival and Non-Archival Submissions:</strong></p>
                <p>Authors can choose whether to submit their work as archival (unpublished) or non-archival (previously published) submissions. Archival papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be part of the ACL Anthology.</p>   

                <p><strong>Submission Templates:</strong></p>
                <p>All submissions must follow the two-column format outlined in the ACL style guidelines. We highly recommend using the LaTeX, OpenDocument, or Microsoft Word templates provided by ACL: <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files" target="_blank">ACL Style Files</a>.</p>
                <p>All papers must be anonymous. This means that author(s) should not be identified on the title page or through self-references. For example, phrases like "We previously showed (Smith, 2020) ..." should be avoided. Instead, use citations like "Smith (2020) previously showed ...".</p>

                <p><strong>Review and Selection Criteria:</strong></p>
                <p>Submissions should present original work, with a clear emphasis on completed research rather than ongoing projects. Authors should explicitly state the current status of their results and provide details on the work's completion. Papers will be evaluated based on their accuracy, originality, technical quality, significance, relevance to the conference topics, and potential interest to the attendees.</p>
                <p>All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process. The final decision regarding acceptance will be made by the workshop organizers. While authors can indicate their preferred workshops, the final placement of papers will be determined by the organizers. Submissions that do not adhere to the above guidelines will be rejected without review.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Presentation Format:</strong></p>
                <p>Accepted papers will be presented either as oral presentations or as posters. The decision regarding the mode of presentation will be made by the workshop chairs and will not reflect the quality of the submission.</p>
